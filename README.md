## 👩‍💻 About Me  

I am a data-driven professional with a strong foundation in data analysis, time series forecasting, database systems, and network analysis, and a growing focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. I am passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights and building analytical solutions that support intelligent, data-informed decision-making.

My work integrates statistical thinking, programming, and visualization to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends across structured datasets. I am particularly interested in how these skills extend into AI-driven systems, including predictive modeling, automation, and intelligent decision support.

I am also developing a solid foundation in security and cloud computing concepts, with the goal of building scalable, secure, and responsible AI solutions that align analytics, infrastructure, and real-world impact. I am actively pursuing opportunities that allow me to grow at the intersection of data science, AI, and modern data platforms.
